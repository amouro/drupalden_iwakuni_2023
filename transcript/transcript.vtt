こんにちは、クリスと申します。今日はDrupalDEN岩国でスペシャルトークをすることになり、光栄です。
今日は沖縄科学技術大学院大学の
2
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.009
リニューアルされたウェブサイトを発表します。
英語で技術的な内容を発表した方がやりやすいのですが、

3
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.040
それでも後で日本語でお話しして、ご意見をいただくのが楽しみです。

4
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.610
Good afternoon. My name is Chris

5
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.490
and my honor to be here to give a special talk today at the DrupalCamp Iwakuni.

6
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.269
Our University, OIST

7
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.940
build the Drupal 7 site in 2011,

8
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.520
which was the first year of its release.

9
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.300
Drupal 7 had the longest lifespan among all the versions, 

10
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.919
and brought significant changes to this platform.

11
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.560
One of these change was the integration of CCK as the content type entity field.

12
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.309
It brought test-driven development to the core.

13
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.989
Additionally, ImageCache was transformed into that ImageStyle.

14
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.439
Last year,

15
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.679
we underwent a two-year journey to rebuild and modernize the website using Drupal 9.

16
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:41.479
In the first part of the talk I will discuss the development and the project management process went through during the website rebuild.

17
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.120
In the second part of my talk,

18
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.089
will delve deeper into the challenges we faced when localizing the website

19
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.879
for our bilingual English and Japanese audiences.

20
00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:05.050
I will share the issue we encountered beyond just translation, and how we address them to provide the best experience to our users.

21
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.420
First.

22
00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.450
a little bit about myself.

23
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.389
I'm a Drupal developer with 14 years of experience in Drupal development.

24
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.499
I have extensive experience in web design and development in traditional Chinese, Japanese, and English.

25
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.319
I'm also a member of the Drupal community, and a former group leader in Taiwan

26
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.630
Outside of Drupal, I'm also interested in coffee, Germany, and cats, and welcome any conversation about those topics as well.

27
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.309
Before jumping to the topic.

28
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.390
Please note that any mention of the vendor or products in this talk are not endorsement

29
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.620


30
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.390


31
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.969
Our old Drupal 7 side served us well. Bringing in over 30 million visits,

32
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.170
and deliver 37,000 pieces of mountain.

33
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.340
In the last 3 years we doubled our monthly visit.

34
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:14.369
The website shares our accomplishment with the world, such as when we have a new lab building were completed

35
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:22.130
when we received high impact rankings in Nature, and when our faculty member won the Nobel Prize recently.

36
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.019
The website continuously to celebrate the success.

37
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.170
However, we continue to strive for innovation and shape the future of research in Japan.

38
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.790
In order to reach these goals.

39
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.850


40
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:48.440
We have to set the new objectives and needed a new website that could deliver our outcome in a more effective and flexible way.

41
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.710
In 2020 OIST set a

42
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.470


43
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.369
strategic plan, and begin to

44
00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.909
emphasize the 3 pillar of activities: Research, Education, and Innovation.

45
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:12.700
It is also our responsibility to raise the awareness of STEM education, contribute to Okinawa and conduct outreach activities in the Japanese society.

46
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.980
Throughout the entire project, we kept these 3 main pillars in mind

47
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:24.960
and made sure that all the website aligned with the organization strategics.

48
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.360


49
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.900
From a technical perspective, our goal was to improve the accountant management experience for editors.

50
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.520
Drupal 9 allows us to use the media library to manage assets

51
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.080
and change the Node translation method to field translation.

52
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:56.459
In addition to Drupal, we also implement a design system to maintain the consistency in user experience and enable editors to easily reuse web component when creating content.

53
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.610
The website project was divided into 3 main phases.

54
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:13.519
We conducted a comprehensive user research with a vendor in December, 2020 to gain better understanding of the stakeholders, both internal and external users.

55
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.690
The study helped us identify how users perceive us.

56
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.040
and how we can improve the website information architecture

57
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.739
In the second phase we hire another vendor to migrate the content and build a new website using Drupal 9.

58
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.150
After the vendor completed the development.

59
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.089
our web team took over the content.

60
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:44.409
We convert it and recreate the content and train the content owner on how to use the new website.

61
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.630
Our developer and I also work on updating and resolving any additional issues.

62
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:59.589
Last December, 2 years after we began the project, we successfully relaunch the website.

63
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.050
It has been well received by the OIST community.

64
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.070
Let's take a quick tour of the site now

65
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.840
We redefine the color scheme and use the new web component throughout the site.

66
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.150
The Mega menu provide the user with a better navigation map.

67
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:27.809
Our media editor can mainly select the related content, or let the system choose a related content for them.

68
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.449
We integrate the flickr into the site

69
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.130
to allow us to preview our photo albums

70
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.770
for different campaign or special committees.

71
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.959
We have a microsite feature

72
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.319
which allows them to manage their own content and display their own logo.

73
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.599
Finally, we have also created a style guide to showcase the components

74
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.009
we design for the website.

75
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.879
Now let's moved on to the technical aspect of our project.

76
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:19.830
I would like to provide a high-level overview of the migration process, and how we manage the Development project.

77
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.580
Migration was the first and the most important factor in our project.

78
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.579
All important content and assets need to be migrated.

79
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:37.349
It wasn't just about migrating the content node. We also had to migrate files and image that were not managing in the CMS.

80
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.070
In Drupal 7,

81
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:52.009
there was no Media Library, so we used the "Video" and "Photo" content type to contain assets, and later use the short code to reference them in the content body.

82
00:07:52.900 --> 00:08:01.639
This means we had to migrate all 3,000 content nodes and over 6,000 media assets first.

83
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.840
and then convert all the inline circle into the new media embed format.

84
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.609
In the past,

85
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:15.719
content editors were able to use the IMCE to upload the files and image to the server directly.

86
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:22.139
During the migration we converted over 1,500 inline file sources into media types,

87
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:31.670
including images, documents, and embedded videos. This not only ensure that all the files in the managed system, but also

88
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.990
makes the system more secure.

89
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:41.699
In total, we migrate more than 10,000 content and assets via the Drupal Migrate API script.

90
00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:48.889
The migrate profile was kept in use in the project to provide mockup data for testing purpose.

91
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:58.139
During each feature development, our local environment and cloud CI environment builds the site with the mockup data every time.

92
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:02.509
This allows us to run the unit test repeatedly

93
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.489
and make our deployment more robust and reliable.

94
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.649
Migration was critical to the project.

95
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:18.260
and require a lot of efforts to review, content, and validate the results but it was worth it.

96
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.319
and play the crucial role in the project's success.

97
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.079
Beyond migration,

98
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.279
There were 3 keys that make the project success.

99
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:34.670
We made sure to keep our team and the Supervisor informed of our progress.

100
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:46.459
OIST is a large organization, with many decision making channel. So when necessary, we met the stakeholder directly, and then find someone who could support and communicate

101
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.060
to the right channel.

102
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:56.540
We use a tool effectively to manage project tasks and assist with the communication.

103
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:03.160
There is no best tool but we find the right tool that all team members were willing to use.

104
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.659
To reduce repetitive tasks and risks,

105
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:12.940
we rely on test and automation process as much as possible.

106
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.420
All these factors work together to make the project a success.

107
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.459
During the first stage of the project, when we work with the vendor

108
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.530
they use the Github and its project tool to manage the tasks.

109
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:33.069
This allowed their developer and us to communicate freely

110
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.139
rather than only through the project manager.

111
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:43.349
This accelerate development made the work transparent and increase the mutual trust.

112
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:52.719
After the project was delivered, we introduced Shortcut to manage both development and content creation tasks on the same platform

113
00:10:53.080 --> 00:11:01.410
With Shortcut, we were able to integrate Github to track the status of the PR and syncing development task status.

114
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:10.169
Many of us already familiar with Github and their project managed tool have been more mature and user-friendly, now.

115
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:17.540
Shortcut is a task management system that can easily manage both development and editing tasks.

116
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:22.209
Given that the task of development and editing require different workflow,

117
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.519
we can create different workflow in shortcut for them.

118
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.379
and then bring them into the same epic or iteration easily.

119
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.440
This is very helpful for a team with multiple functions.

120
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.930
In shortcut. We can quickly sync the status of dev tasks with Github.

121
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:47.139
even though they are two separate platform, we can work between them seamlessly.

122
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:53.540
We are a two-developer development team and need to focus on tasks and resolving issues.

123
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.629
The CI/CD process act as a third developer.

124
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.969
checking the code standard and deploying the code for us.

125
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:10.699
This allow our developer to quickly move on to the next task after committing the code to the online development environment.

126
00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.310
Once the commit passed the CI/CD workflow,

127
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.709
we can then focus on reviewing the logic of the code in pull request.

128
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:23.230
And then ask the CI/CD to deploy it to the production site.

129
00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.680
With all the tools, script, and continuous communication.

130
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.750
we were able to complete the project smoothly.

131
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.790
Of course, the diligent team members

132
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.320
were the core of the project's success.

133
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:43.970
OIST is a unique graduate university in Japan, with over 50% of our

134
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.350
members being international, including employees and students.

135
00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.429
Our Cell signal Unit is a diverse example.

136
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.520
With the leading faculty. fellow researchers and students from different countries.

137
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.079
As a result,

138
00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:03.050
English and Japanese are equally important at OIST,

139
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:09.270
and most of the content on our website is translated into both languages

140
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:16.420
During the project we dealt with many translations issues, and in the second part of this talk.

141
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:23.770
I'd like to focus on a few of them, particularly for our Japanese and APAC region attendees today.

142
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.839
Drupal has well-defined translation system in core.

143
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.830
Depends on your experience and role.

144
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.319
There are always ways for you to make translations

145
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.149
As a site builder,

146
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.509
We can translate nodes with the field translation enabled.

147
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.640
Also, we can translate many strings that appears in the user interface.

148
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:50.389
As a themer, we use TWIG to mark translatable sentence with a variable in it.

149
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.949
As a developer,

150
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:55.540
we can mark the translatable string with the t() function.

151
00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.359
It is also capable to use dynamic variable in the sentence.

152
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:05.550
However, there might be a chance that we need a translation context,

153
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:11.500
because a word could be verb or noun, or has more than one meaning.

154
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.569
For example,

155
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.650
"Contact"

156
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.310
It will be translated into two different words in Japanese

157
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.819
as the action "コンタクト"

158
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.119
or as a section label in "連絡先".

159
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:30.040
There are more details about localizing user experience in my talk at the latest DrupalCon Prague.

160
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:41.050
If you're interested and work on bilingual sites often, it would be helpful for you. But today I want to focus on the issues specific to the project and related to the Japanese languages.

161
00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.319
One issue to consider is the date format

162
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:45.780
in Japan

163
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.270
as well as in Taiwan.

164
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:53.170
We typically use a format that starts with the year followed by the months and day.

165
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.259
In the other country we often see this date format.

166
00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.490
which can be interpreted

167
00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:10.500
as either September 12th or December 9th, depending on the country. For example, most European countries read it as December 9th, while the United States.

168
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.149
read it as September 12th.

169
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.719
Given the diversity of our University members.

170
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:23.190
we have to find a common way to ensure our understanding of information is consistent.

171
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:29.419
Therefore we use the ISO 8601 format in English UI, as it is the same order

172
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.940
of format for the Japanese UI.

173
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:41.189
Another issue to consider is typing in Japanese, Chinese, or Korean, often referred to as CJK languages.

174
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:49.810
Typing Roman alphabet on a keyboard is relatively easy. But how are words typed in CJK languages?

175
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:59.420
Here are some paragraph in CJK about "What to do if you receive the positive COVID-19 notification from the Health Center".

176
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.140
you can see

177
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.689
that in CJK languages

178
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.989
the sentence rarely have spaces.

179
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:10.500
To index the content to the database and make it easy to search.

180
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.279
Sometimes we need extra treatment.

181
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.259
So how do we type? What's this CJK keyboard looks like?

182
00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.089
From the left to right

183
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.399
we see two traditional Chinese keyboards.

184
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:32.940
and there are two Korean keyboards layouts, and two Japanese layouts, one in mobile, and the other one is a compact keyboard with the 50

185
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.479
essential sounds characters.

186
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.060
For those who don't understand the language.

187
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.210
They may look like a puzzle, right?

188
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.759
When typing the words, the keystrokes vary.

189
00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.729
For the word "Computer".

190
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:55.339
we can also tell. It is different in traditional Chinese used in Taiwan or simplified Chinese in China

191
00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:02.470
when typing CJK text, a word is completed only when all the segments is typed.

192
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.790
Unlike typing English.

193
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.730
there might be possible worry combination before finish the typing.

194
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.000
In this clip

195
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.050
it shows that inputting

196
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:22.480
Japanese kanji requires typing one to four or even more the phonetic elements.

197
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.230
Additionally.

198
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:29.320
there are different words in Kanji, which have the same pronunciation.

199
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.879
This can lead to an issue in the search box,

200
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:35.850


201
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:41.260
where the search is triggered too early before the actual keyword is completed.

202
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.889
which can be annoying for the users.

203
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:52.729
This issue can be improved by implementing a special JavaScript event method to wait for the completion of the keyword input

204
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.460
before the people triggering the search.

205
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.000
In this clip

206
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.919
we can see some improvement.

207
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:15.119
We can find the English typing words normally, and the Japanese word for Corona only queries the result when the word is completed.

208
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:24.470
In Drupal, there are autocomplete fields for tags or referencing entities.

209
00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:29.350
The core had the issue before, but it was fixed in 2016.

210
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.600
Thanks to the Drupal contributors.

211
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:40.919
Mainly, it is the CompositionEvent that helps us to identify the special event when the typing is finished.

212
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:48.289
When we created this custom autocomplete search box, we had to implement the event as well.

213
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.170
First we detect the starting point of the CJK input method.

214
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.000
Next, we wait until the word is decided.

215
00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:02.120
as we see the CompositionEnd event happens.

216
00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.779
Finally, we send this AJAX request

217
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:16.190
After the typing issue. Let's see some sorting issue. In English, we even sort with the alphabet of the title of articles.

218
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.150
taxonomy tags or names, for example.

219
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.320
However, it is entirely different when sorting in Japanese or Chinese.

220
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:25.780


221
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.899
In Japanese language, most of us know it is

222
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.310
usually order with the 五十音

223
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:33.380


224
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.999
and also there are Kanji or Chinese characters, too.

225
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.830
when we have an array composed

226
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:45.730
of Latin letters, numbers, Hiragana, Katagana

227
00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.090
and Kanji.

228
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.260
How do we sort them correctly?

229
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.359
The ideal order in Japanese language should looks like these on the right.

230
00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:03.680
Starting with simple number alphabet like in English, and then Hiragana, Katagana, and the last part the Kanji.

231
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:10.010
Hiragana and Katagana follows the order of 五十音. But what is the order in Kanji?

232
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.730
If we use the sort() function directly.

233
00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:20.919
it will usually sort the array based on an indexed number of each characters in the Unicode table.

234
00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:30.799
However, this doesn't make sense for Japanese speakers, as the order of the characters doesn't reflect the proper way to sort them in the language.

235
00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:41.670
One solution is to use the JavaScript function localeCompare(). this function sorts Kanji based on the pronunciation of the first character

236
00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:45.860
and then the next character if the first characters is the same

237
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:56.790
In PHP, there is also a similar function to do the sorting, but it is recommended to use a database query for better sorting results from the backend.

238
00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:04.759
However, this is not perfect yet. There is one word misplaced in the middle

239
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.370
岩下

240
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:12.040
It is because the Kanji has another pronunciation.

241
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.040


242
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:17.889
The first characters is read in an alternative way "がん"

243
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.640
rather than "いわ"

244
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:29.869
Another example, there is another last name can be called either かわの or こうの using the same Kanji.

245
00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:36.870
So in Japanese or in Mandarin Chinese the character could have more than one pronunciation.

246
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:41.179
How many characters has more than one pronunciation?

247
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:49.520
Japanese country has more than 600 out of 2,000 common characters which has more than one pronounciations.

248
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:54.620
In the official definition from the Ministry of Education of Taiwan,

249
00:21:54.970 --> 00:22:01.440
there were 1,200 out of 5,000 commonly used traditional Chinese characters

250
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:04.509
around 10 years ago

251
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:09.890
officials reviewed and merged many of them, reducing the number down to 

252
00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.459
580

253
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.399
Let's take the Kanji for example.

254
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:19.999
It has more pronunciation due to different cultural contexts.

255
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:25.379
Four of them are inherited from the ancient Chinese in various eras.

256
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:30.370
Another four represent the original Japanese language.

257
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.270
The original Chinese character looks very similar.

258
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.530
and it has three pronunciations.

259
00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:47.949
The character stands for 樂 (yue) for "music" or 樂 (le) for "happy or happiness", or 樂 (yao) for the verb "to appreciate".

260
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.570
So we

261
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:56.249
now know Japanese sort by pronunciation. How about Madarin Chinese?

262
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.270
Let's bring some delicious Taiwanese food here.

263
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.080
They are in the order of

264
00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.920
my preference

265
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.720
How do we sort their names using their attribute?

266
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.070
Let's first see what options do we have.

267
00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.410
This is the first characters of Iwakuni

268
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:15.990
"Yán" in Mandarin.

269
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.739
There are at least four different ways to sort it.

270
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.769
We can count its radical strokes.

271
00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.709
total strokes.

272
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.790
spell it with phonetical

273
00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.329
elements 注音

274
00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:37.560
which is only used in Taiwan, or Pinyin with roman characters which is the main input method in China.

275
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.720
Usually we order with one of the attributes.

276
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:49.820
And sometimes let the user change the sorting method. For instance, the book search system in a library

277
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:58.350
in traditional Chinese localeCompare() function also works with the various attributes that I mentioned before

278
00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.900
By strokes

279
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:02.319
or by the phonetic 注音.

280
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:09.670
This is sorting with the phonetic element 注音. Similar way that we saw Japanese 五十音.

281
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.979
It would be difficult to understand, if you don't understand 注音.

282
00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:16.509
But the other way be easier.

283
00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:19.090
This is sorting in the total strokes.

284
00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.280
we can see the first characters of each

285
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.340
has more strokes from left to right.

286
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.559
It's amazing that JavaScript supported, right.

287
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:34.039
It is all thanks to the open source contributors, especially in the Unihan project.

288
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.819
a sub branch project

289
00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.900
under the Unicode open source project.

290
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.269
That makes this available.

291
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:48.509
Let's think about the unresolved issue, what to do with the multiple pronunciation in Kanji?

292
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:57.009
the issue affects Japanese Kanji, or a Chinese characters when sorting with the phonetic elements 注音 or Pinyin.

293
00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:02.329
Technically, native speakers know the common variations of the pronunciation.

294
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.589
When we process in head, it is processed together.

295
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:11.620
It doesn't really bother the native speakers when the

296
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.049
different pronunciation mixed together.

297
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.450
However, my understanding could be wrong about Japanese.

298
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.710
I would be happy to hear from you what is the pratical solution here.

299
00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:28.960
Sometimes, if the clients request to make it in a explicit order.

300
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:34.660
the better way is to map the word into a predefined table or array.

301
00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:40.769
At the end, I want to share a sentence with you.

302
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.660
We hear people say

303
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.700
"Devil is in the details"

304
00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:51.140
It means the difficulty or troubles is not revealed until you look close to the details.

305
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.029
The origin of the sentence is somehow opposite.

306
